Nothing mounts yet, and no module has been built or loaded. This file is
the one to correct rather than to argue with: if a claim here is stale, it
is a defect.

## What has been verified

All nine gates pass, and since 2026-08-26 they pass with no environment
variables set on a machine that has the kernel of record installed: the
syntax gate finds that tree, and the style gate finds its `checkpatch.pl`.
What that unattended style run can say is narrower than it looks, and the
narrow half is the useful one: the found checker's `sha256` does not match
the baseline's, so an unchanged set is reportable and a moved set is not.
The gate exits 2 rather than charge a move to the code, which means the
one run that matters, the run after a carried file lands, needs
`CHECKPATCH` pointed at the checker the baseline names. That happened
twice on 2026-08-26. ArtNix's delegator, which runs these same gates from another
repository, enumerates `script/test-*.sh` instead of naming them, so a gate
added here is picked up there without an edit. Each gate prints its own
count, and the gates are the authority; the dated figures below are snapshots
of one run.

`test-checkpatch.sh` is the one that commonly cannot run. It needs
`checkpatch.pl`, which no kernel headers package ships, so it exits 2 unless
`CHECKPATCH` or `KDIR` points at a full source tree. That is could-not-run,
not a pass.

- `script/test-shim.sh` and `script/test-syntax.sh`: 6 and 28 on 2026-08-26,
  two of the thirty-four being controls that must fail and do. The shim
  gate's sixth check is the one that reads its own coverage: an inline the
  driver never calls is barely checked by the compile, and the count says
  whether any are missed.
- `script/test-checkpatch.sh`: holds the style deviation set at its recorded
  856 hits under the checkpatch.pl the baseline names, and under the kernel
  of record's own patched copy, which differs by sha256 and produces an
  identical set. Neither figure travels without the checker that produced it;
  856 quoted bare reads as a mainline number and is not one. With no baseline
  present the gate refuses rather than writing one.
- `script/test-history.sh`: resolves every commit the roadmap's history
  table pins and checks its subject still matches, then prints how many
  commits touching `src/` or `script/` have landed since the newest row.
  That second half never fails, since whether a commit deserves a version row
  is a judgment.
- `script/test-inventory.sh`: the directory is the population, and three
  hand-maintained lists claim to cover it: the origin table in this file, the
  Makefile's `hammer2-y`, and the filenames `script/test-syntax.sh` names one
  by one. A `.c` missing from the second is dead code; missing from the third
  is a file no compiler ever sees while every check reports passing. It also
  checks the origin table's line count against the file, which is the column
  that rots on an ordinary edit, and two rows had drifted before the check
  existed. A count column that is not a number is left alone.

  `test/` is a second population, added 2026-08-26 after two vector files
  were found tracked and named in no document here. Every file there is now
  either named by a gate or listed in `README.testing.md`. Both vector files
  turned out to be compiled by a gate in ArtNix, which no search of this
  repository could have said, so that table records a contract with a
  consumer this tree does not reference.

- `script/test-citations.sh`: every `file:line` citation in a `doc/` table
  resolves, and where the row names a symbol, that symbol is on the line. The
  64 KiB inventory is thirteen such rows and nothing had ever read them. A
  line number rots on the next edit while still looking like a citation, and
  the 0.2 import edits exactly those files. It compares against the source
  line, never a stored baseline, and a row naming no symbol is reported as
  unanchored rather than dropped.

That the gates pass means the shim is valid C in both knob positions, and
that `hammer2.h` and `hammer2_io.c` type-check against the real kernel
headers of a 7.2 tree with both clang 22 and gcc.

It does not mean anything runs. `-fsyntax-only` compiles nothing and links
nothing, and no module has been built or loaded. There is no VFS layer, no
mount path and no fsck integration, so there is nothing to run yet.

## The version floor, and how it was established

`BLK_MAX_BLOCK_SIZE` is the binding constraint, at **6.15**. Each symbol
was dated by reading the header at the tag rather than from memory:

| symbol | absent at | present at |
|---|---|---|
| `bdev_file_open_by_path` | | v6.10 |
| three-argument `kvrealloc` | v6.11 | v6.12 |
| `folio_mark_dirty_lock` | v6.12 | v6.13 |
| `BLK_MAX_BLOCK_SIZE` | v6.14 | v6.15 |

6.15 is the floor the code requires, not a floor that has been exercised.
The kernel of record is a different claim: this tree compiles against the
latest Linux, pinned in `script/test-syntax.sh` as `KERNEL_REF` and bumped
when a release ships.

Until 2026-08-26 this file said "the gates run on 7.2" and nothing checked
it. They did not. The newest kernel tree on the workstation was 7.1.9, with
no 7.2 in `/lib/modules`, `/usr/src` or the store, and the gate has always
printed the kernel it used in its header line while nobody compared that
string to the rule. A verdict is read off "0 failed". The gate now refuses a
tree that is not the kernel of record, with COULD-NOT-RUN rather than a
pass.

What has actually been compiled, measured rather than assumed, on
2026-08-26 under the deliberate `H2_KERNEL_REF` override:

| kernel tree | result |
|---|---|
| **7.2.0-cachyos**, the kernel of record | **7 checks, 0 failed, both compilers, no override** |
| 7.1.9-artix1-2 | 7 checks, 0 failed, both compilers, under the override |
| 6.18.46-1-lts | 7 checks, 0 failed, both compilers, under the override |

A 7.2 version string can be present with no 7.2 build tree behind it. Where
`linux-api-headers 7.2-1` is installed, `/usr/include/linux/version.h` reads
`LINUX_VERSION_MAJOR 7` and `LINUX_VERSION_PATCHLEVEL 2` beside no build tree
at all: UAPI headers, no `Makefile`, nothing to compile a module against. Anything answering "is 7.2 here" by grepping for a version string
finds that and is wrong. `script/test-syntax.sh` reads `VERSION` and
`PATCHLEVEL` from the build tree's own `Makefile` instead.

**The port type-checks against its kernel of record**, measured 2026-08-26
after the chaotic 7.2.0-cachyos `dev` output was substituted into the store
(679 MB, `sil5r7r2a25nsshkqpd5jjjd0g7ywyi7`). The gate's own line, quoted
rather than summarised:

    hammer2 against 7.2.0-cachyos via the store, matching the kernel of record,
      dialect -fms-extensions, with clang version 22.1.8, matching the tree's own:
    syntax: 7 check(s), 0 failed against the kernel of record (7.2)

measured at `ca4c07a`. The revision matters because this tree is a live
checkout another repository reads while work is being committed to it:
ArtNix's delegator once saw 6 gates where it expected 7, having walked the
tree mid-commit, which is indistinguishable from broken unless the revision
is printed beside the count.

The compiler is a pin too, and the tree says which one instead of this
repository asserting one. kbuild records what built the kernel in
`CONFIG_CC_VERSION_TEXT`, which reads `clang version 22.1.8` here, and this
workstation's clang is byte-identical to it. So that version is the
matching one rather than an old one, and the gate prints the comparison on
every run - against the 6.18 and 7.1.9 trees it says `NOT the tree's own,
which is "gcc (GCC) 16.2.1 20260810"`.

Every syntax result recorded before that timestamp was measured against
7.1.9 and read as 7.2. An overridden run now says so in its own summary
line: until that day it printed `syntax: 7 check(s), 0 failed`, identical
to what a real reading prints, and the override is a loosened threshold
whose hiding place was that line.

**It is 7.2.0-cachyos and not mainline 7.2.** `EXTRAVERSION` is set by a
`sed` in the derivation's `postPatch`, so the release string is the
distribution's by recipe. "Against the kernel of record (7.2)" is what the
gate says and is true; "against mainline 7.2" would not be, and the two are
one word apart.

Two properties of a nixpkgs kernel `dev` output that any later measurement
has to know. Its `source/` directory is pruned hard: the recipe rsyncs the
tree, deletes `drivers` wholesale, deletes unused arches, then deletes every
file it did not mark read-only. Measured here: 10,944 headers, 81 `.c` files,
no `drivers` directory. A grep of that tree for implementation code measures
the prune, not the kernel, so absence there is the normal case and not
evidence. And `checkpatch.pl` lives under `source/scripts`; `build/scripts`
holds gdb helpers.

That checker is not mainline's: its `sha256` differs from the one the
baseline records. Run against this tree it has twice produced the deviation
set unchanged, at 764 hits on 2026-08-26 and at 856 after `hammer2_ondisk.c`
landed the same day, so cachyos's patches do not move this tree's style
figures. Both readings are of the tree as it stood, not of a constant. The
gate says the hash does not match while accepting the version its own tree
reports, and prints the two halves separately.

The first run against the real tree failed, and the guard was wrong rather
than the tree. A nix dev output's `build/Makefile` is a three-line stub
that sets `KBUILD_OUTPUT` and includes the real Makefile from the `source`
directory beside it, so `VERSION` and `PATCHLEVEL` are not in the file the
gate was reading. It follows the `include` line the stub itself names now,
which is derived from the artifact rather than assuming a sibling
directory, and `linux-api-headers` still fails because it has no `Makefile`
at all to follow.

## What is not here

`hammer2_inode.c`, `hammer2_strategy.c`, `hammer2_ioctl.c`,
`hammer2_vfsops.c`, `hammer2_vnops.c`.

The carried set is eight files at 11,204 lines, measured against all three BSD
ports: `hammer2_chain.c`, `hammer2_flush.c`, `hammer2_freemap.c`,
`hammer2_bulkfree.c`, `hammer2_xops.c`, `hammer2_admin.c`,
`hammer2_cluster.c` and `hammer2_subr.c`. `hammer2_ondisk.c` landed on
2026-08-26 and is not in it: half of it is carried and the device half is
this port's, which is what `doc/provenance.csv` records as `derived`.
Whether `hammer2_inode.c` joins the carried set is what that same carry
column will say.
`hammer2_strategy.c`, `hammer2_ioctl.c`, `hammer2_vfsops.c` and
`hammer2_vnops.c` are the OS-facing ones and are rewrites.

`hammer2_chain.c` landed on 2026-08-26 and the lock recursion it forced is
decided, following the NetBSD port: there is no recursive lock. A Linux
`rw_semaphore` deadlocks against its own holder exactly as a NetBSD
`krwlock` does, so `hammer2_mtx_init_recurse()` is a plain init in the
shim and the one path that recursed is closed instead of accommodated.
That path is `hammer2_chain_lookup()` reaching `chain->lock` again for an
inode in DIRECTDATA mode; NetBSD closes it by never setting
`HAMMER2_OPFLAG_DIRECTDATA`, which costs a data block for a tiny file and
costs no correctness. The flag is set in `hammer2_inode.c`, so that half
of the change lands when that file does, and until then the port has a
non-recursive lock and no code that recurses it.

`hammer2_flush.c` landed on 2026-08-26 and took the port decision it needed
rather than a shim. Its OS-dependent surface is one function,
`hammer2_xop_inode_flush`, and everything else in the file is chain logic
that carried unchanged. Three edits, each marked `XXX` in place:

The device cache flush. DragonFly hands a zero-length `BUF_CMD_FLUSH` buf to
`vn_strategy()`, FreeBSD allocates a GEOM bio carrying `BIO_FLUSH`, and
NetBSD and OpenBSD both collapse it to one `VOP_IOCTL(DIOCCACHESYNC)`.
Linux has that single call, `blkdev_issue_flush()`, so this follows the two
ports that agree rather than the one this tree otherwise carries.

The per-device `VOP_FSYNC`, which writes back a device vnode's dirty
buffers. Linux writes back a block device's dirty pages with
`sync_blockdev()`, which needs no lock from the caller, so the
`vn_lock`/`VOP_UNLOCK` pair around it went with it.

The volume header write. FreeBSD uses `getblk`/`bwrite` on the buffer
cache; this port keeps the device's pages in the DIO layer, so it goes
through `hammer2_io_bread` and `hammer2_io_bwrite` instead. The DIO layer
does not export the read-skipping form of `getblk`, so the block is read
before all 64 KiB of it is overwritten. The write is the same size either
way, and the path does not execute until the write milestone.

None of the three is exercised. The whole core type-checks under both
compilers with warnings as failures, which is what 0.2 claims and all it
claims; nothing here has run.

### Logging

Every line `hprintf` prints names the module, and a line the core builds
out of several calls stays one line. Neither was true before 2026-08-26,
and neither is visible in a compile, so `test-shim.sh` reads both out of
the preprocessor's own output rather than taking a comment's word.

Linux's native mechanism for the first is `#define pr_fmt` at the top of
every `.c` file, ahead of the first kernel header. That is unavailable to
the files that do most of the logging here: they are carried
byte-for-byte, and adding a line to one is the edit this tree exists to
avoid. Measured with only `hammer2_io.c` carrying the define, five
carried files held every other call site and printed anonymously. The
name now lives in `hprintf` itself, which is this port's macro, so there
is one copy of it and no file has to remember anything.

**The literal prefix is `hammer2: `**, and a gate matching dmesg from 0.3
on should match that. It is `KBUILD_MODNAME`, which kbuild derives from
`obj-m += hammer2.o` in `src/sys/fs/hammer2/Makefile`, so it cannot drift
without the module's own filename drifting with it. Under
`HAMMER2_INVARIANTS` the function name, command and pid follow it; without
the knob, the function name alone. Both shapes start with `hammer2: `.

The second is `printf`, which on a BSD kernel appends to the open line;
`hammer2_bulkfree.c` prints a range with `hprintf` and no newline and
finishes it with `printf`. `pr_info` closes a record per call, so that
mapping turned one line into two and dropped the second's prefix.
`pr_cont` is Linux's name for the semantics the core is written against.

It is not free. `pr_cont` deliberately does not apply `pr_fmt`, so a `printf`
that opens a line prints without the module name. Every plain
`printf` in the carried core was classified by hand on 2026-08-26, all
thirteen of them:

| where | sites | kind | under `pr_cont` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `hammer2_bulkfree.c` | 7 | continuations of an `hprintf` that opened the line | correct, and one line |
| `hammer2_chain.c`, in `hammer2_dump_chain` | 2 | continuations | correct, and one line |
| `hammer2_chain.c`, in `hammer2_dump_chain` | 4 | line starts | correct line structure, no module name |

So four lines in the tree print anonymously, all four inside one debug
tree dumper, and no status or error path is among them. The alternative
mapping reverses that trade: `pr_info` names those four and splits the
other nine into eighteen lines, half of them unprefixed anyway. Neither
macro can be right at both kinds of site, since the discriminator is whether
the previous call ended in a newline, which is a runtime fact.
The `DEFER` in `hammer2_os.h` names the only mapping that is right at
both: build the line in a buffer and emit it once, which is a core edit.

checkpatch flags `pr_cont` deliberately and by name, and the deviation is
recorded in `README.kernel-style.md`.

### `XXX` marks: how much of the core is not a carry

0.2's fourth exit criterion asks for this count. An `XXX` is the BSD ports'
mark for a mapping that is not mechanical, so the number says how many places
a reader should distrust. Counting raw occurrences answers the wrong
question, the carried files arriving with upstream's own. Measured 2026-08-26
against the FreeBSD port at
`3df307f` (v1.2.13), by file, ours minus upstream's:

| file | `XXX` | upstream's | this port's |
|---|---|---|---|
| `hammer2_chain.c` | 18 | 18 | 0 |
| `hammer2_freemap.c` | 6 | 6 | 0 |
| `hammer2_bulkfree.c` | 4 | 4 | 0 |
| `hammer2_xops.c` | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| `hammer2_io.c` | 4 | 2 | 2 |
| `hammer2_os.h` | 4 | 0 | 4 |
| `hammer2_flush.c` | 13 | 8 | 5 |
| `hammer2_subr.c` | 7 | 0 | 7 |
| `hammer2_cluster.c` | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| `hammer2_ondisk.c` | 18 | 1 | 17 |

Thirty-five are this port's, the right-hand column summed, and the count
rose by seventeen on 2026-08-26 with `hammer2_ondisk.c`, which is the
first file whose OS half was rewritten rather than carried. Twenty-nine of
the thirty-five sit in a file that came from upstream; the other six are
in the two files this port wrote from nothing.

`hammer2_admin.c`, `hammer2_freemap.c`,
`hammer2_xops.c`, `hammer2_bulkfree.c`, `hammer2_chain.c`,
`hammer2_cluster.c` and `hammer2_mount.h` are still byte-identical to that
upstream commit under `cmp`, so most of the carried core has no port edit
of any kind, marked or unmarked.

`hammer2_flush.c`'s five are the three port decisions above and the two
local variables those decisions changed the type of, all inside one
function. `hammer2_subr.c`'s seven are the densest set in the tree and the
file is the smallest carried one, which is what a file of small
OS-touching helpers looks like: two are the `timespec64` signatures the
carried `hammer2.h` had already chosen, one is the include line, one the
timestamp call, one the signal check, one the pair of functions that are
not carried at all, and one the local variable the timestamp changed.

`hammer2_ondisk.c`'s seventeen are the port's largest set and split nine
to eight, counted by function on 2026-08-26. Nine are on the device side,
which is the half this port wrote: the file's opening comment, the GEOM
open and close, the init and cleanup split the Linux open call forced, and
`hammer2_access_devvp()`. The other eight are in the carried half, and
every one of them is a one-line substitution rather than a change of
logic: four in `hammer2_verify_volumes_common()` (the GEOM consumer local,
the media size read off the block device, the `devvp` field name, and the
uuid comparison the kernel has no formatter for), two signature lines in
`hammer2_init_volumes()`, the read call in `hammer2_read_volume_header()`,
and the formatter in `hammer2_print_uuid_mismatch()`. That is the property
worth checking: no carried function here had its control flow edited, and
a reviewer can confirm it one mark at a time.

The other six are in the two files this port writes: two in `hammer2_io.c`
and four in `hammer2_os.h`, one of them the non-recursive lock above.
